The WHY:
Oahu Community Correctional Center has a lengthy and troublesome visitation process.  Many of the visitors fill out numerous forms and wait all day just to get denied because of something missing.  

We held a meeting with the OCCC staff and identified key aspects and problems in their visitor registration process. In result, HATS has implemented an automated visitation process for OCCC by creating a website for the visitors to submit an online form. As you can see, the visitors are able to input all of their information and add any additional visitors.  Once finished, they can submit the form and will be processed and sent to the database were OCCC staff can approve the form. From there, the OCCC Staff can approve and verify meeting times and general information of the visitors.

The WHO: 
The process is lengthy for both the visitors attempting to visit the site, and the staff attempting to verify everyone coming in. We wanted to build out a solution that helps a portion of our population get accumalated back into society by providing the needed day-to-day contact to ensure a stable mindset. Being able to talk to your loved ones is a critical part of our functioning society; being removed from that interaction doesn't help to rehabilitate those who have been incarcerated. By making this process smooth and efficent, we wanted to create a web application that helps the visitors, staff, and the inmates. Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, not harder.  

The HOW: 
Our perfect solution would be to create a centralized web application that will allow both visitors and staff to save a lot of time and have an easy registration process. Being able to access this site from the web on any device is extremely important. Compatibility with devices such as phones, tablets, and even general desktop support is an important aspect. A simple to use, easy to navigate website was our target goal.
