      <h2>Visitation Policy</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="w3-container">
	  <h4><b>VISITATION PROCEDURES</b></h4>
	  <p>Visitation is a privilege and not a right. These privileges may be restricted if either the
inmate/visitor violates rules. An individual directed to leave OCCC premises due to rule
violations/conduct and refuses compliance, will be charged with trespassing; also, visitation
privileges may be suspended from the date of occurrence up to 1 year. Visitation schedules
are subject to change/cancellation at any time.</p>
	  <p>Inmate must submit a list of visitors for approval. Inmates are advised to submit visit requests
to the Visitation Officer for all visitors (i.e. immediate family member, friends) during the first
week of incarceration. The list shall consist of no more than 12 people including family
members/friends. The Visitation Officer usually authorizes visitors to be placed on the
approved list within 30 days. Immediate family members (i.e. father, mother, sister, brother,
half-sister, half-brother, grandmother, grandfather, spouse, and inmates? own children) may
visit for the first 30 days of incarceration. Proof of relationship must be provided. When a
permanent visitation list is established at the end of the first 30 days, only those individuals on
the approved list may be allowed to visit.</p>
	  <p>Individuals on active parole/probation must obtain in writing, permission to visit. No former
inmates will be allowed to visit unless prior written approval is granted from the Warden or the
Warden?s designee. Former inmates must be off supervision and have the recommendation of
their supervising agent. Even if the supervising agent recommends the visit it must still be
approved in advance by the Warden and will be limited to immediate family members. Former
inmates who were victims of the crime or convicted as part of the crime, will not be allowed to
visit. Any rules that the PSD has regarding visits of this type will also apply and, approval will
be required.</p>
	  <p>During each visiting period, inmates are only allowed 2 visitors. Inmate?s parents are counted
